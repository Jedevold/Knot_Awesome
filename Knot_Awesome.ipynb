    "No available datasets exist for machine learning applications of knot theory research. The purpose of this program is to generate an arbitrary realistic dataset of labeled knot images and gauss codes to train an AI on. Additionally, while packages exist to generate images of knots, there are currently know packages that create knot projections with gaps between strands to denote a crossing strand going 'under' another crossing. To this end, this project builds on and adds this functionality to the Pyknotid package."
